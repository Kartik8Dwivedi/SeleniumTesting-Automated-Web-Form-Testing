# Automated Web Form Testing


This repository contains an automated Selenium test suite built with C# and NUnit, designed to test a web form hosted at `http://app.cloudqa.io/home/AutomationPracticeForm`.

## Features

- Tests text input fields with resilient assertions.
- Selects gender radio button.
- Selects state from dropdown.
- Inputs date of birth.
- Uploads a file (Resume.pdf) using Selenium's file upload functionality.
- Uses headless ChromeDriver for running tests.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd SeleniumTest
    ```

2. Make the ChromeDriver executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_chromedriver.sh
   ./setup_chromedriver.sh
   ```

3. Restore dependencies and build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```
## Running Tests
To run the tests, ensure you have the ChromeDriver set up and then execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet test
```
## Notes   
- Ensure that the `DummyFiles/Resume.pdf` file exists in the specified directory.
- The file DummyFiles/Resume.pdf is copied automatically to the build output directory and used for the file upload test.
- The project uses implicit and explicit waits for element resilience.
- The tests are designed to run in headless mode, which means they won't open a browser window. If you want to see the browser actions, you can modify the `SeleniumTest.cs` file to remove the headless option.
- The tests are resilient to minor changes in the form, such as field order or additional fields, as long as the essential fields remain present.
- `setup_chromedriver.sh` grants execution permission to the chromedriver binary if included in the repo.

## Test Run Output

Below is a screenshot of the console output after running the tests successfully:
